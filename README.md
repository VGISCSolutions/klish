# Klish Project

## About

The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX systems.

For stable klish version 2 see the "2.2" branch.

It is configurable by XML files. The KLISH stands for Kommand Line Interface
Shell. I know that "command" starts with "c" :) .

The klish is a fork of clish 0.7.3 project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/clish/).
The original clish was developed by Graeme McKerrell. The klish obtain some new
features but it's compatible (as much as possible) with clish's XML
configuration files. The author of klish project is Serj Kalichev.

The main target for the klish is a Linux platform. Additionally it can be build on
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, QNX. The klish project is written in C.

The klish development is sponsored by "Factor-TS" company http://www.factor-ts.ru/.

## Build

NOTE:
You need branch "2.2" for stable version.

Klish project needs XML parsing library like libxml2. See the documentation for details.
