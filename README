# Klish Project

The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX systems.

It's not functional for now.
For stable klish version 2 see the "2.2" branch.


## Homepage

http://klish.libcode.org.


## Documentation

See the homepage and sourcecode tree "doc/" dir for documenation.


## Repository

https://src.libcode.org/pkun/klish

NOTE:
You need branch "master" for development non-stable version.
You need branch "2.2" for stable version.


## Contributing

Use klish mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/klish-dev to send patches.
The best practice is to use "git format-patch" to format patch and "git send-email" to send it.
It's great when the patch (or email) contain description for patch.


## Build

The development master branch needs libfaux (http://faux.libcode.org) to be built.
The stable branch 2.2 doesn't need libfaux library.
